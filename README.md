# AsciiNurse

This crate provide a parser for (Asciidoctor)[https://asciidoctor.org/] written in (Rust)[https://www.rust-lang.org/]. 
AsciiNurse is not a super fast, super optimized, zero copy swag parser, it's primarily learning project.


The main goal is to provide an correct parser for Asciidoctor which might be difficult since (AsciiDoctor does not have a spec at the moment)[https://asciidoctor.org/news/2019/01/07/asciidoc-spec-proposal/]
